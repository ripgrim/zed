## PR #48118

## No Documentation Updates Needed

**Reason**: Internal implementation improvement for Flatpak environment variable handling

**Changes reviewed**:

- The diff adds code to preserve `ZED_*` environment variables when the Zed CLI restarts from within a Flatpak container to the host system
- This is an internal bug fix that ensures environment variables are properly propagated across the Flatpak boundary
- No user-facing features, settings, or commands are added or changed
- Users don't interact with this restart mechanism directly - it's an implementation detail of how the Flatpak version handles certain operations
- The change makes existing functionality work correctly in edge cases rather than introducing new behavior that needs documentation

## PR #48467

````markdown
## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary

Auto-update notifications have been moved from the activity indicator to the title bar, with a new visual design including multiple progress states, dismiss functionality, and integration with the user menu.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/update.md

- **Section**: New section after "Auto-updates"
- **Change**: Add
- **Suggestion**: Add a new section describing the update notification UI:

```markdown
## Update notifications {#update-notifications}

> **Note:** In Zed v0.224.0 and above, update notifications appear in the title bar as described below.

When an update is available, Zed displays a notification in the title bar showing the update progress:

- **Checking for updates**: Shows when manually checking for updates
- **Downloading**: Appears while the update downloads in the background
- **Installing**: Shows briefly during installation
- **Ready to update**: When an update is ready, click the notification to restart Zed and apply the update

You can dismiss the update notification by clicking the X button. When dismissed, a badge appears on your user avatar, and "Restart to update Zed" appears at the top of the user menu.

If an update fails, an error notification appears. Click it to view the error log.
```
````

#### 2. docs/src/update.md

- **Section**: "How to check your current version"
- **Change**: Update
- **Suggestion**: Add an alternative method mentioning the user menu (since version info is typically there in apps), or clarify that `zed: about` is the primary method. Consider adding that update status appears in the title bar when available.

### Notes for Reviewer

- The existing documentation doesn't describe where/how update notifications appear, so this fills that gap
- No screenshots currently exist in update.md, but screenshots showing the new title bar button states would enhance the documentation
- The `SimulateUpdateAvailable` action is a debug feature and doesn't need documentation
- The core auto-update behavior (automatic checking/downloading) hasn't changed, only the UI presentation

## PR #48553

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The permission system has been refactored from a simple `always_allow_tool_actions` boolean to a granular `tool_permissions` structure with a global `default` setting and per-tool configuration. The documentation files already use version-specific notes correctly ("In Zed v0.224.0 and above").

### Suggested Changes

No changes needed - the documentation already follows the correct pattern with version-specific callouts.

### Notes for Reviewer

The documentation is comprehensive and accurate. It correctly documents:

- The new permission precedence order
- Pattern-based rules for all supported tools
- MCP tool permission configuration
- Migration path from the old `always_allow_tool_actions` setting
- Built-in security rules that cannot be overridden
- Version-specific notes indicating when the feature was introduced

## PR #48592

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary

The `:bd` and `:bdelete` vim commands now close the active item across all panes instead of just the current pane. This is a new behavior change that requires documentation for vim mode users.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/vim.md

- **Section**: File and window management (under Command palette section)
- **Change**: Add
- **Suggestion**: Add the following two rows to the "File and window management" table after the existing commands:

```markdown
| `:bd[elete]` | Close the active item across all panes |
| `:bd[elete]!` | Close the active item across all panes (including pinned) |
```

Additionally, add an explanatory note after the table to clarify the behavior with version context:

```markdown
> **Note:** The `:bd[elete]` command (available in Zed v0.224.0 and above) closes the active item in all panes where it appears. If a file is open in multiple panes, all instances will be closed. Use `:bd[elete]!` to also close pinned items.
```

### Notes for Reviewer

- The `:bd`/`:bdelete` command is a common vim command for "buffer delete"
- The new behavior differs from vanilla vim - in vim, `:bd` closes the buffer globally, but in Zed it closes the item across all panes
- The `!` modifier enables closing pinned items, which maps to the `close_pinned: true` parameter in the action
- This might be surprising to vim users who expect different behavior, so clear documentation is important

## PR #48814

## Documentation Updates Needed

### Summary

This change adds support for `.devcontainer.json` at the project root as an alternative to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Users can now place their devcontainer configuration in either location, expanding compatibility with projects that use the root-level pattern.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/dev-containers.md

- **Section**: Configuration file locations (or create new section if doesn't exist)
- **Change**: Update/Add
- **Suggestion**: Update any section that lists where devcontainer configuration files can be placed to include:

```markdown
## Configuration File Locations {#config-locations}

> **Note:** In Zed v0.224.0 and above, `.devcontainer.json` at the project root is supported in addition to the locations below.

Zed supports dev container configurations in the following locations:

1. `.devcontainer.json` in your project root
2. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (the standard location)
3. `.devcontainer/<subfolder>/devcontainer.json` (for named configurations)

When multiple configurations are present, Zed will prompt you to choose which one to use.
```

#### 2. docs/src/dev-containers.md

- **Section**: Getting started or Setup section
- **Change**: Update
- **Suggestion**: If there are any examples showing only `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, consider adding a note that `.devcontainer.json` at the root is also supported, for simpler single-configuration setups.

### Notes for Reviewer

- The core functionality of devcontainers likely already has documentation; this change only expands the supported file locations
- The version-specific note should only apply to the new `.devcontainer.json` root location support, not to existing `.devcontainer/` directory support
- The change improves compatibility with the devcontainer spec, which officially supports both locations

## PR #48912

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary

The split diff view feature has been promoted from feature flag to general availability, with the default `diff_view_style` changed from "unified" to "split". This affects how users see diffs in the editor when viewing file changes.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/editor.md (or docs/src/editor/settings.md if it exists)

- **Section**: New section under editor settings
- **Change**: Add
- **Suggestion**:

````markdown
### Diff View Style {#diff-view-style}

> **Note:** In Zed v0.224.0 and above, split view is the default. Prior versions used unified view.

When viewing diffs in the editor (such as Git changes), you can choose between two display styles:

- **Split** (default): Shows the original and modified versions side-by-side in separate panes
- **Unified**: Shows changes inline with additions and deletions in a single view

To change the diff view style, open Settings ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}) and search for "Diff View Style", or add to your settings file:

```json [settings]
{
  "diff_view_style": "unified"
}
```
````

You can toggle between split and unified views while viewing a diff using {#kb editor::ToggleSplitDiff}.

```

#### 2. docs/src/version-control.md (if it exists, or relevant Git documentation page)
- **Section**: Viewing changes or Git diff section
- **Change**: Add/Update
- **Suggestion**: Add a note about the diff view style setting, cross-referencing the editor settings documentation. If there's existing content about viewing diffs, update it to mention that split view is now the default and how to toggle between views.

### Notes for Reviewer
- The default has changed from "unified" to "split" - this is a behavioral change users will notice immediately
- The feature was previously behind a staff-only feature flag, so this is effectively a new feature for most users
- I assumed the setting applies to Git diffs and similar diff views, but the specific use cases should be verified
- The keybinding `editor::ToggleSplitDiff` exists for toggling between views - verify this is the correct action name and that it works with both view styles
