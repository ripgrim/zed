## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
This change introduces a new setting `search_on_input` (defaulting to `true`) that automatically triggers project search as users type, replacing the previous "hit enter to search" behavior. Documentation needs to reflect this behavioral change and the new setting.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/features/search.md

- **Section**: "Project Search" or similar workflow section
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: "search files in project"
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Search Across Your Project
  description: Search for text patterns across files using project-wide search in Zed.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: Include at least 3 internal links such as:
  - Link to settings reference for `search_on_input`
  - Link to buffer search documentation
  - Link to keyboard shortcuts reference
  - Marketing link to `https://zed.dev/features` (if this is a main feature page)
- **Suggestion**:

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Update the project search workflow description to reflect the new default behavior:

```markdown
## Project Search

Start typing in the search field to begin searching across your project. Results appear as you type, with matched text highlighted in the results panel.

To disable automatic search and require pressing Enter instead, toggle "Search on Input" in the Settings Editor under Editor > Search, or set:

```json
{
  "editor": {
    "search": {
      "search_on_input": false
    }
  }
}
```

When automatic search is disabled, press Enter after typing your query to start the search.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Yes. Review the entire search.md file to ensure all sections pass brand rubric, removing any hedging language like "simply" or "just", using second person consistently, and maintaining technical precision throughout.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4     | Directly describes the feature mechanism |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Clean imperative voice, no hedging |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 4     | States facts without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Provides JSON alternative, trusts reader |
  | Information Priority | 5     | Leads with behavior, settings follow |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Exact setting path and default state |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5     | Second person, present tense |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | No marketing claims |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

#### 2. docs/src/reference/all-settings.md

- **Section**: "Search On Input" (existing entry)
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: "search settings reference"
- **Frontmatter**: (already present in reference doc)
- **Links**: Minimal internal links appropriate for reference documentation
- **Suggestion**:

The diff already updates this section correctly:

```markdown
### Search On Input

- Description: Whether to search on input in project search.
- Setting: `search_on_input`
- Default: `true`
```

Also removes the stale `search_on_input_debounce_ms` setting that no longer exists in the codebase.

- **Full-file brand pass**: Yes. Review settings descriptions throughout all-settings.md for consistent voice—ensure all descriptions use present tense, avoid hedging, and state what the setting does rather than what it "allows" or "enables."

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5     | Precise technical description |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Direct, clean phrasing |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5     | No qualifiers |
  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Assumes understanding |
  | Information Priority | 5     | Setting name, default, purpose |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Exact default value |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5     | Consistent with reference format |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | Pure facts |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer

1. The code changes the default from `false` to `true`, making search-on-input the default behavior. The UI hint text also changes from "Hit enter to search" to "Start typing to search" when enabled.

2. The incremental search implementation includes significant internal optimizations (excerpt range expansion, merge handling) that reduce UI flicker but don't require user-facing documentation beyond the setting itself.

3. VSCode import mapping is included (`search.searchOnType` → `search_on_input`), which may warrant a note in migration docs if such a page exists.

4. The "Changed in Preview" callout should be used since this modifies existing project search behavior—users upgrading will notice the different default.
