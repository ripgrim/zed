# PR #49051: git_graph: Add basic keyboard navigation

_Merged: 2026-02-12T20:29:24Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/49051_

Based on my analysis of the code diff and the existing documentation, I can now provide my assessment.

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The code adds keyboard navigation support (up/down arrow keys) to the Git Graph feature, allowing users to select commits using `SelectPrevious` and `SelectNext` actions, with automatic scrolling to keep selected items visible. This is a new user-facing feature that requires documentation.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/git.md

- **Section**: New section to be added after "Diff Hunk Keyboard Shortcuts"
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: git graph keyboard navigation
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: Zed is a text editor that supports lots of Git features
  title: Zed Editor Git integration documentation
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Command Palette](./getting-started.md#command-palette)
  - [custom key bindings](key-bindings.md#custom-key-bindings)
  - [File History](#file-history)
  - Marketing link: Consider adding a link to zed.dev Git features page if one exists
- **Suggestion**: 

Add a new section before "Action Reference":

```markdown
## Git Graph Navigation

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

The Git Graph visualizes your repository's commit history with branch topology. You can open it from the Git Panel's overflow menu or via the Command Palette.

### Keyboard Navigation

Navigate through commits using your keyboard:

- **Select previous commit**: {#action menu::SelectPrevious} ({#kb menu::SelectPrevious})
- **Select next commit**: {#action menu::SelectNext} ({#kb menu::SelectNext})

When you select a commit, Zed automatically scrolls the graph to keep it visible and loads the commit's diff in the adjacent pane.

> **Tip:** You can also click on any commit in the graph to select it and view its changes.
```

Then update the Action Reference table to include:

```markdown
| {#action menu::SelectPrevious}            | {#kb menu::SelectPrevious}            |
| {#action menu::SelectNext}                | {#kb menu::SelectNext}                |
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The existing file scores well on the brand rubric (technical grounding, natural syntax, direct voice), but contains some minor issues:
  - Line "Zed monitors your repository so that changes you make on the command line are instantly reflected" could be more specific about what "instantly" means
  - The "Quick Stash Operations" section heading could be more descriptive ("Working with Recent Stashes" is clearer)
  - Some sections use passive voice where active would be stronger (e.g., "Conflicting files appear" → "Zed highlights conflicting files")

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4/5   | Explains mechanics clearly; could add more specifics about auto-scrolling behavior |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Reads naturally, no awkward phrasing |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States capabilities without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Direct instructions, no hand-holding |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Leads with what you can do |
  | Specificity          | 4/5   | Names specific actions/keybindings; could detail scroll strategy |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches rest of Git docs |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | Only claims what's implemented |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. **PASSES**

### Notes for Reviewer

- The Git Graph feature itself appears to be an existing feature, but keyboard navigation is the new addition
- I placed this section near the end of the document after File History since Git Graph is a visualization feature similar to File History but for the entire repository rather than a single file
- The `menu::SelectPrevious` and `menu::SelectNext` actions are generic actions from the menu crate that are being reused here, which is why they don't have git-specific names
- Consider whether Git Graph needs its own more prominent section or subsection under an existing section like "Project Diff" if Git Graph is a more commonly used feature
