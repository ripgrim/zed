_Merged: 2026-02-13T07:18:55Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48851_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The REPL now supports interactive input requests from Jupyter kernels (like Python's `input()` function), requiring documentation updates to explain this new user-facing feature.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/repl.md

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

- **Section**: New section after execution output documentation
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: jupyter notebook input prompt
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: REPL and Jupyter Notebooks in Zed
  description: Execute code interactively with Jupyter kernels and handle input prompts in Zed's REPL environment.

  ```

  - [Language support](/docs/languages)
  - [Settings](/docs/settings)
  - Marketing link: [Zed REPL features](https://zed.dev/features/repl)
- **Suggestion**:

Add a new section titled "Interactive Input" after the existing output documentation:

```markdown
## Interactive Input

When code execution requires user input (such as Python's `input()` function), the REPL displays an input prompt below the cell output.

Type your response in the text field and press `Enter` to submit. The kernel receives your input and continues execution.

For password inputs, characters appear masked with asterisks for security.

If execution is interrupted while an input prompt is active, the prompt automatically clears when the kernel returns to idle state.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The existing REPL documentation should be reviewed for voice consistency, particularly any instances of hedging language ("simply", "just") and ensuring all technical claims are grounded in specific behavior rather than subjective quality assessments.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5     | Concrete behavior: text field, Enter key, masked passwords |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Direct imperative voice, no awkward constructions |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5     | States facts without hype or qualifiers |
  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Trusts reader to understand without hand-holding |
  | Information Priority | 4     | Leads with what happens, minimal context fluff |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Exact interaction: type, press Enter, masked asterisks |
  | Voice Consistency    | 4     | Matches Zed's direct style (assumes full file passes) |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | No claims, only factual description |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer

This is a new user-facing feature that changes how users interact with REPL cells. The documentation focuses on the mechanics of input prompts rather than implementation details. The change is additive (new capability) rather than a modification of existing behavior, so the "Preview" callout format is appropriate.
