# PR #46766: json_schema_store: Include available LSP adapters in settings schema

_Merged: 2026-02-12T14:58:38Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/46766_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
This change enhances LSP adapter discovery in the JSON schema store to include "available" LSP adapters (those registered via `register_available_lsp_adapter` but not bound to specific languages). This allows users to see and configure LSP adapters in settings autocomplete even before they're explicitly loaded, improving discoverability of available language servers.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/configuring-languages.md
- **Section**: Existing "Language Servers" section
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: configure language servers in Zed
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Configuring Languages in Zed
  description: Learn how to configure language servers, formatters, and syntax highlighting for your development workflow.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Language Server Protocol settings reference](/docs/languages#language-server-settings)
  - [Available language servers list](/docs/languages#available-language-servers)
  - [Task configuration](/docs/tasks)
  - Marketing link: [Zed language support](https://zed.dev/languages)
- **Suggestion**: Add clarification that autocomplete in the `lsp` settings object now shows all registered LSP adapters, including those not yet loaded. Update the section describing how LSP configuration works to note:

  > **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).
  >
  > When configuring language servers in your `settings.json`, autocomplete suggestions include all available LSP adapters recognized by Zed, not only those currently active for loaded languages. This helps you discover and configure language servers before opening files that use them.

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The existing file may contain hedging language ("you can easily configure...") or marketing-style phrasing that needs removal. Scan the entire file for:
  - Hedging words: "simply", "just", "easily"
  - Marketing superlatives or hype
  - First-person or third-person voice instead of second-person
  - Ensure all keybindings use `{#kb action::Name}` syntax
  - Verify "folder" not "directory", "project" not "workspace"

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4     | Explains concrete autocomplete behavior change |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Clear, direct sentence structure |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 4     | States the feature without overselling |
  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Assumes competence, explains "why" (discoverability) |
  | Information Priority | 4     | Leads with user impact (autocomplete shows more adapters) |
  | Specificity          | 4     | Names the specific setting location and behavior |
  | Voice Consistency    | 4     | Maintains second-person present tense |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | Makes no unearned claims |
  | **TOTAL**            | 35/40 | Pass threshold met (all criteria 4+) |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer
- This is primarily a backend enhancement for schema resolution. The user-facing impact is improved autocomplete accuracy in LSP settings.
- The deduplication logic added in the diff is an implementation detail and doesn't need explicit documentation.
- If there's a separate reference page listing all available LSP adapters, verify it remains accurate (though this change doesn't alter which adapters are *available*, only how they're discovered for schema purposes).
