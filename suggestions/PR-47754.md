# PR #47754: Fix VSCode tasks.json parsing for tasks without explicit labels

_Merged: 2026-02-12T16:30:47Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/47754_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
VS Code task definitions now support auto-generating labels when omitted. This makes task configuration more convenient and aligns with VS Code behavior. Users need to understand this new behavior and the generated label formats.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/tasks.md
- **Section**: Existing "VS Code Task Format" section (or create if missing)
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: VS Code task compatibility
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml

  title: Tasks - Zed
  description: Configure and run tasks in Zed using tasks.json for builds, tests, and custom commands.

  ```

  - [Running tasks](/docs/tasks#running-tasks)
  - [Keybindings](/docs/key-bindings)

- **Suggestion**: 

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

When importing VS Code tasks from `.vscode/tasks.json`, you can omit the `label` field. Zed automatically generates labels based on the task type:

- **npm tasks**: `npm: <script>` (e.g., `npm: start`)
- **gulp tasks**: `gulp: <task>` (e.g., `gulp: build`)
- **shell tasks**: Uses the `command` string directly (e.g., `echo hello`), or `shell` if the command is empty
- **Tasks without type**: `Untitled Task`

Example task file with auto-generated labels:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "start"
    },
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cargo build --release"
    }
  ]
}
```

These tasks appear in the task picker as "npm: start" and "cargo build --release". You can override the generated label by providing an explicit `label` field.

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Would need to review entire `tasks.md` file to ensure consistent voice throughout—checking for hedging language ("simply", "just"), ensuring second-person voice, verifying technical grounding in all sections, and confirming logical heading hierarchy. 

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Concrete examples with actual formats, no vague claims |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct, clear sentences with natural flow |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hedging or hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Provides technical details developers need |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Leads with behavior, follows with examples |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact label formats for each task type |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches Zed docs conventions throughout |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | Only states verifiable behavior |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 | All criteria pass threshold |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer
- Placement depends on current structure of tasks.md—if there's already a VS Code compatibility section, add there; otherwise create new subsection under task configuration
- The generated label behavior exactly matches VS Code's implementation, so this is a compatibility feature worth documenting for users migrating from VS Code
- Consider adding a note in migration guides if one exists
