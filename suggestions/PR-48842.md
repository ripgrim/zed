## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The Git Graph feature has been enhanced with double-click support to open commit views and a new button in the Git Panel to access Git Graph. These user-facing additions require documentation updates.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/git/git-graph.md

- **Section**: New section "Opening Commit Details"
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: open git commit details
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Git Graph - Visualize Repository History
  description: View your Git repository history with an interactive graph showing branches, commits, and relationships.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Git Panel](/git/git-panel.md) 
  - [Commit View](/git/commit-view.md) if that page exists, otherwise reference the feature
  - [Keyboard Shortcuts](/configuration/key-bindings.md)
  - Marketing link: [Git Integration on zed.dev](https://zed.dev/git) (if applicable)
- **Suggestion**: 

Add after the main introduction section:

```markdown
## Opening Git Graph

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

You can open Git Graph from the Git Panel by clicking the graph icon button in the previous commit section, or use {#kb git_graph::Open}.

## Opening Commit Details

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

To view detailed information about a commit:

- Double-click any commit in the graph
- Or select a commit and press {#kb git_graph::OpenCommitView}

This opens a Commit View showing the full diff, commit message, and metadata.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review entire file to ensure it uses second person, present tense, avoids hedging words, and maintains technical grounding throughout.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Describes concrete actions and UI elements |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct, conversational commands |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Provides info without condescension |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Leads with how-to, minimal filler |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact actions (double-click, keybinding) |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches Zed docs style |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No unearned superlatives |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

#### 2. docs/src/git/git-panel.md

- **Section**: Update existing section on previous commit display
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: git panel features
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Git Panel - Manage Changes and Commits
  description: Stage changes, create commits, and manage your Git workflow directly in Zed.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**:
  - [Git Graph](/git/git-graph.md)
  - [Commit View](/git/commit-view.md)
  - [Git Integration overview](/git/overview.md) if it exists
  - At least 3 total internal links for non-reference context
- **Suggestion**:

In the section describing the previous commit display, add:

```markdown
> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

The previous commit section now includes a graph icon button that opens [Git Graph](/git/git-graph.md) to visualize your repository history.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Scan the entire Git Panel documentation for voice consistency, ensure all setting references follow the Settings Editor → JSON pattern, verify keybindings use `{#kb}` syntax, and confirm terminology uses "folder" not "directory".

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | References specific UI element |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Clear, direct description |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | No unnecessary qualifiers |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Assumes user competence |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Concise, actionable |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Names exact UI button and feature |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches docs conventions |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | States capability factually |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer

The Git Graph action was renamed from `git_graph::Open` in the code to be dispatched from `git_ui::git_panel::Open`, but this is an internal implementation detail that doesn't affect user-facing documentation. The keybinding reference `{#kb git_graph::Open}` should resolve correctly to the appropriate user-facing action name.

If a Commit View documentation page doesn't exist yet, consider creating it or adjust the internal link references accordingly.
