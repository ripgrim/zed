## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
Added inline "Add Project to Workspace" button to each project entry in the recent projects picker, replacing the previous footer button. This improves discoverability and usability by placing the action next to the project entry itself.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/projects.md
- **Section**: "Managing Projects" (or similar existing section about project management)
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: add project to workspace
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Managing Projects in Zed
  description: Open projects, add folders to your workspace, and switch between recent projects in Zed.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Multibuffer editing](/multibuffers)
  - [Opening files and folders](/file-navigation)
  - [Workspace settings](/settings)
  - Marketing: https://zed.dev/features/projects (if main feature page)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Update the section describing how to add projects to your workspace to reflect the new inline button:

**Old behavior**: "Add Project to Workspace" button at the bottom of the picker.

**New behavior**: Click the `+` button next to any local project in the recent projects picker to add it to your current workspace. You can also use the `+` button in the search bar or the {#kb workspace::AddFolderToProject} keybinding.

The inline button appears only for local projects (not remote or dev containers) and adds the selected project's folders to your active workspace without closing the picker.

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review entire `docs/src/projects.md` file for:
  - Eliminating any instances of "simply", "just", "easily"
  - Ensuring second-person present tense throughout
  - Confirming keybinding syntax uses `{#kb action::Name}` format
  - Verifying "folder" not "directory", "project" not "workspace"
  - Adding internal links if fewer than 3 exist
  - Checking all sections score 4+ on brand rubric

- **Brand voice scorecard** (for suggested text above):

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Describes specific UI elements and behavior |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct instructions without hedging |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Clear instructions, no hand-holding |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Leads with what changed, then how |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact button location and behavior |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches second-person present tense |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No marketing claims, just facts |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 | Pass |

### Notes for Reviewer
- The change affects only the UI presentation of the "Add Project to Workspace" feature, not its underlying functionality
- The button now appears inline for each local project rather than in the footer, and also in the search bar
- Remote and dev container projects don't show the inline button (same restriction as before)
- If there's no existing "Managing Projects" section in projects.md, this content should be added to whichever section currently documents adding folders to workspaces
