_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48619_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The default value for `single_file_review` in agent settings changed from `true` to `false`. This is a user-facing behavior change that affects how agent edits are displayed. Developers need to know the new default and how to re-enable the feature if desired.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/agents/configuration.md

- **Section**: Agent Settings (or create if missing)
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: agent configuration settings
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Configure AI Agent Behavior
  description: Customize agent profiles, edit display modes, and feedback preferences in Zed.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Agent overview](/agents)
  - [Agent commands reference](/agents/commands)
  - [Settings editor](/settings)
  - Marketing link: [Agents on zed.dev](https://zed.dev/agents)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Update or add the `single_file_review` setting documentation to reflect the new default:

```markdown
### Edit Display Mode

By default, agent edits open in multi-file review mode. To display agent edits in single-file editors instead:

1. Open the Settings Editor with `{#kb zed::OpenSettings}`
2. Search for "single file review"
3. Enable **Agent: Single File Review**

Or add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "single_file_review": true
  }
}
```

When enabled, each file modified by an agent opens in its own editor tab for review. When disabled (default), all changes appear in a unified review interface.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review the entire `configuration.md` file (if it exists) for:
  - Remove any hedging language ("simply", "just", "easily")
  - Ensure second-person present tense throughout
  - Verify Settings Editor shown before JSON examples
  - Use keybinding syntax like `{#kb action::Name}` instead of hardcoded keys
  - Confirm "folder" not "directory", "project" not "workspace"
  
- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Specific setting names, concrete UI paths |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct imperative instructions |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | No hedging, states facts clearly |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Assumes competence, provides both UI and JSON |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Behavior described before how-to |
  | Specificity          | 4/5   | Could mention specific use cases for each mode |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches established Zed docs style |

### Notes for Reviewer

The test rename (`test_singleton_agent_diff` → `test_single_file_review_diff`) and the test setup changes to explicitly enable `single_file_review` confirm this is an intentional default change. The feature itself still exists and works, but users who were relying on the previous default will now see different behavior.

If `docs/src/agents/configuration.md` doesn't exist, this content should be added to the most relevant existing agents documentation file, or a new configuration page should be created following the site's navigation structure.
