# PR #49069: Preserve panel zoom state across workspace switches

_Merged: 2026-02-12T21:59:28Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/49069_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
This change fixes focus behavior when switching between workspaces while a panel is zoomed. Previously, switching workspaces would unexpectedly close zoomed panels; now focus management respects the zoomed state and keeps panels open.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/workspace/panels.md
- **Section**: Existing "Zooming Panels" section (or new section if none exists)
- **Change**: Add clarification
- **Target keyword**: zoom panel workspace
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Using Panels in Zed
  description: Control side panels, zoom panels for focus, and manage panel visibility across workspaces.

  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Multi-workspace documentation](/workspace/multi-workspace.md)
  - [Keyboard shortcuts reference](/keybindings.md)
  - [Settings documentation](/configuring-zed.md)
  - Feature page link: [Zed workspace features](https://zed.dev/features/workspace)
- **Suggestion**: Add or clarify behavior in the zooming section:

```markdown
> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

When you zoom a panel, it expands to fill the workspace and receives focus. The zoomed state persists when you switch between workspaces—Zed keeps the panel zoomed and focused when you return to that workspace.

To zoom a panel, use {#kb workspace::TogglePanelZoom} or click the zoom icon in the panel toolbar. Zoom again to restore the panel to its normal size.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review entire `panels.md` file to ensure:
  - No hedging language ("simply", "just", "easily")
  - Direct second-person instructions throughout
  - Keybindings use `{#kb}` syntax consistently
  - "Folder" terminology (not "directory")
  - Settings shown with UI-first pattern where applicable

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Describes concrete behavior (focus, zoom state persistence) |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct statements without filler |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States what happens, no hedging |
  | Developer Respect    | 4/5   | Clear instructions, assumes competence |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Behavior first, then method |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact behavior: "persists when you switch between workspaces" |
  | Voice Consistency    | 4/5   | Matches Zed docs second-person style |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No marketing language, just facts |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 |       |

### Notes for Reviewer
This is a bug fix that changes existing behavior, warranting the "Changed in Preview" callout. The change is subtle but user-facing: zoomed panels now remain zoomed across workspace switches instead of being dismissed. If `docs/src/workspace/panels.md` doesn't exist or lacks a zooming section, the suggestion should be added to whichever file currently documents panel zoom behavior.
