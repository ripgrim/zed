## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The diff view style terminology changed from "stacked"/"side by side" to "unified"/"split", and the default setting value changed accordingly. This previously undocumented feature now needs clear documentation explaining the two diff view styles and how to configure them.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/git.md

- **Section**: New section after "Project Diff"
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: diff view styles in git
- **Frontmatter**: (existing frontmatter is adequate)
- **Links**: Links to Settings Editor, all-settings reference, and keybindings documentation are included
- **Suggestion**:

Add a new section after the "Project Diff" section (after line discussing word diff highlighting):

```markdown
### Diff View Styles

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** Terminology updated from "stacked"/"side by side" to "unified"/"split". See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Zed supports two diff view styles:

- **Unified** (default): Shows changes inline with added and deleted lines stacked vertically
- **Split**: Displays old and new versions side by side in separate panes

To switch between styles while viewing diffs, use the view toggle buttons in the buffer search bar, or use the {#action editor::ToggleSplitDiff} action.

To change the default style, open the Settings Editor ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}) and search for "diff view style", or add this to your settings.json:

```json [settings]
{
  "diff_view_style": "unified"
}
```

Valid values: `"unified"` or `"split"`.

> **Note:** If you previously used `"stacked"` or `"side_by_side"` in your settings, update them to `"unified"` or `"split"` respectively.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The existing git.md content passes brand rubric criteria (scores 4+ on all dimensions). The suggested addition maintains this standard by being direct, specific, and avoiding marketing language. No other sections require voice edits.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Precise terminology, clear technical distinction between view styles |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct sentences, no awkward constructions |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hedging ("Zed supports") |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Provides Settings UI and JSON paths, includes migration note |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Default behavior first, then customization options |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact setting names, values, and actions specified |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches existing git.md tone and structure |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No unearned claims, purely descriptive |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 | Pass - all criteria 4+ |

#### 2. docs/src/reference/all-settings.md

- **Section**: New setting entry in Editor section (alphabetically between existing settings)
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: diff_view_style setting reference
- **Frontmatter**: (existing frontmatter is adequate for reference pages)
- **Links**: Reference pages typically have fewer internal links, but includes link to git documentation for context
- **Suggestion**:

Add to the Editor settings section (find appropriate alphabetical location):

```markdown
### Diff View Style

- Description: How to display diffs in the editor.
- Setting: `diff_view_style`
- Default: `"unified"`

**Options**

- `"unified"`: Show changes inline with added and deleted lines stacked vertically (default)
- `"split"`: Display old and new versions side by side in separate panes

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** Values renamed from `"stacked"`/`"side_by_side"` to `"unified"`/`"split"`.

See [Git documentation](../git.md#diff-view-styles) for more details.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The all-settings.md file follows a consistent reference format throughout. The suggested addition maintains this pattern. No other sections require voice edits.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Clear description of technical behavior |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Reference-appropriate concise format |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States capabilities directly |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Complete options with clear defaults |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Default highlighted, all options documented |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact values and descriptions provided |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches all-settings reference format |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | Purely descriptive, no marketing |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 | Pass - all criteria 4+ |

### Notes for Reviewer

- The diff view styles feature existed before but was undocumented. This adds that missing documentation.
- The terminology change (`stacked` → `unified`, `side_by_side` → `split`) is noted in both locations so users with existing configurations know to update their settings.
- The action name changed from `ToggleDiffView` to `ToggleSplitDiff` - this is reflected in the documentation with the correct action syntax.
- No existing documentation references the old terminology, so no cleanup of old references is needed.
- The version number (v0.225) in the callouts is a placeholder - should be updated to the actual Preview version number when known.
