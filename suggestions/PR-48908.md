## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The diff view toggle buttons now support Cmd/Ctrl+click to set a default diff view preference in settings, allowing users to configure their preferred view style from the UI rather than editing JSON.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/search/buffer-search.md (or docs/src/editing/diff-view.md if separate)
- **Section**: Diff view controls (or new section if this doesn't exist)
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: set default diff view Zed
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Diff View in Zed
  description: Switch between stacked and side-by-side diff views and configure your default preference.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - Internal: [Editor settings](/settings/editor), [Search documentation](/search), [Git integration](/git)
  - Marketing: https://zed.dev/features/git (if this is a main feature page for diff viewing)
- **Suggestion**:

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

When viewing diffs in the search bar, you can toggle between two view modes:

- **Stacked**: Shows changes inline within a single pane
- **Side by Side**: Shows original and modified content in separate panes

To toggle between views, click the diff view buttons in the search toolbar. To set your default view preference, hold {#kb gpui::Modifiers::secondary_key} while clicking either button. This updates your `editor.diff_view_style` setting.

You can also configure the default in your [settings file](/settings/editor):

```json
{
  "editor": {
    "diff_view_style": "stacked" // or "side_by_side"
  }
}
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review the entire file to ensure all content meets rubric standards—remove any "simply", "just", "easily" qualifiers, verify all settings show UI-first approach, confirm keybindings use `{#kb}` syntax, and ensure consistent second-person voice throughout.

#### 2. docs/src/settings/editor.md
- **Section**: Existing `diff_view_style` setting entry (if it exists) or new entry in editor settings reference
- **Change**: Update/Add
- **Target keyword**: diff_view_style setting
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Editor Settings Reference
  description: Complete reference for Zed's editor configuration options including diff views, indentation, and display preferences.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - Internal: [Search documentation](/search), [Git integration](/git), [Settings guide](/settings)
- **Suggestion**:

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

**`diff_view_style`** (string)

Controls the default layout for diff views.

- `"stacked"`: Shows changes inline within a single pane
- `"side_by_side"`: Shows original and modified content in separate panes

Default: `"stacked"`

You can set this preference from the UI by holding {#kb gpui::Modifiers::secondary_key} while clicking the diff view toggle buttons in the search toolbar.

```json
{
  "editor": {
    "diff_view_style": "side_by_side"
  }
}
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Scan the entire settings reference for any hedging language, ensure all settings follow the pattern of Settings Editor UI instructions first then JSON alternative, verify internal links are present and useful, and confirm consistent terminology (e.g., "folder" not "directory").

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Exact setting values, specific behavior |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Reference-appropriate concise descriptions |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | Straightforward documentation tone |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Complete technical details without hand-holding |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Setting function stated first, details follow |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact values, clear modifier key reference |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches reference documentation style |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | Pure factual content |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

### Notes for Reviewer
- The exact file paths may differ (e.g., diff view documentation might be in a separate file or integrated with git/search docs)
- If no dedicated diff view documentation exists, this could be added to the buffer search documentation
- The `{#kb gpui::Modifiers::secondary_key}` syntax should render as the appropriate modifier key for the user's platform (Cmd on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere)
