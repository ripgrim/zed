## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The OpenRouter provider no longer provides a default fast model, which affects how the assistant panel selects models when OpenRouter is configured. This is a behavior change that should be documented for users who rely on OpenRouter.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/assistant/configuration.md
- **Section**: Provider-specific configuration (likely under OpenRouter section if it exists, or a new subsection)
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: configure openrouter assistant models
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Configure Assistant Models
  description: Select and configure language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, and other providers for the Zed assistant.

  ```
- **Links**: 
  - `/assistant/model-context-protocol` (related assistant configuration)
  - `/assistant/prompts` (assistant customization)
  - `/configuration/settings` (general settings reference)
  - `https://zed.dev/assistant` (marketing page for main feature)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

When using OpenRouter as your assistant provider, you must explicitly select a model in your settings. OpenRouter no longer provides a default model selection.

Configure your preferred OpenRouter model in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "version": "2",
    "provider": {
      "name": "openrouter",
      "default_model": "openrouter/auto"
    }
  }
}
```

The `openrouter/auto` model automatically routes your requests to the most appropriate available model. You can also specify any model available through OpenRouter's API.

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The entire assistant configuration page should be reviewed to ensure all provider sections use consistent technical language, avoid hedging words like "simply" or "just", and maintain the direct second-person voice. Any marketing-style claims about model capabilities should be replaced with factual descriptions.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4/5   | Uses concrete API/setting names, actionable code |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct statements, no awkward passive constructions |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hype or hedging |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Assumes competence, explains why not just what |
  | Information Priority | 4/5   | Leads with the change, provides solution |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact setting path and example value |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches established docs voice |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | Only factual statements about behavior |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 |       |

### Notes for Reviewer
This is a breaking behavior change for OpenRouter users. Previously, the assistant would fall back to a default fast model (`openrouter/auto`), but now users must explicitly configure a model or OpenRouter won't work. The documentation should make this clear and provide the migration path (setting `openrouter/auto` explicitly if they want the previous behavior).

The change affects the `default_fast_model()` method returning `None` instead of the auto-router model, which means the assistant panel will not have an automatic fallback when OpenRouter is selected without explicit model configuration.
