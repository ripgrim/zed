# PR #48978: Use document symbols' ranges to derive their outline labels

_Merged: 2026-02-12T07:36:48Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48978_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The code changes add contextual prefixes (e.g., "struct Foo" instead of just "Foo") to document symbol names displayed in breadcrumbs, outline panel, and outline view. This improves user understanding by showing the symbol type alongside the name.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/editor/breadcrumbs.md
- **Section**: Existing content about how breadcrumbs display
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: editor breadcrumbs navigation
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Navigate code with breadcrumbs in Zed
  description: Use breadcrumbs to see your current location in code and quickly jump between symbols and files.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Outline panel](/ui/panels/outline-panel.md)
  - [Go to symbol](/editor/navigation.md#go-to-symbol)
  - [Project panel](/ui/panels/project-panel.md)
  - [Code navigation](https://zed.dev/features/code-navigation) (marketing)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Update the description to note that breadcrumbs now show enriched symbol names with type prefixes:

```markdown
Breadcrumbs display your current location in the file, showing the file path and any containing symbols (functions, classes, structs, etc.). Symbol names now include their type prefix (e.g., "struct Foo", "fn main") to provide clearer context about the symbol you're viewing.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review entire breadcrumbs.md to ensure consistent technical grounding and avoid any hedging language. If the file uses phrases like "simply" or "just", remove them. Ensure all keybindings use `{#kb action::Name}` syntax.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Describes specific UI behavior with technical precision |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct, present tense, natural sentence flow |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States what the feature does without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Assumes reader understands symbol types |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Leads with what changed, provides context |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Concrete examples of prefix format |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches Zed's established technical tone |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No unearned superlatives, factual only |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

#### 2. docs/src/ui/panels/outline-panel.md
- **Section**: Content describing what the outline panel displays
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: outline panel code structure
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: View code structure with the outline panel
  description: Navigate your codebase using the outline panel to see functions, classes, structs, and other symbols at a glance.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**:

  - [Go to symbol](/editor/navigation.md#go-to-symbol)
  - [Project panel](/ui/panels/project-panel.md)
  - [Editor navigation](/editor/navigation.md)
- **Suggestion**:

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Update the description of symbol display to reflect the enriched naming:

```markdown
The outline panel displays the hierarchical structure of your code. Each symbol entry now shows its type prefix (such as "struct", "fn", "mod", "impl") along with the symbol name. This helps you quickly identify what kind of symbol you're looking at without needing to open the file.

For example, in a Rust file you might see:
- `struct Foo`
- `fn main`
- `mod my_module`
- `impl MyTrait`
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review the entire outline-panel.md file. Remove any marketing language or hedging terms. Ensure descriptions focus on what the feature does rather than why it's useful (unless context is necessary for correct usage). Check that all keybindings use proper syntax.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Concrete examples with actual symbol syntax |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Clear, direct language without filler |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States behavior factually |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Doesn't over-explain symbol types |
  | Information Priority | 5/5   | Information-first with practical examples |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Shows exact format with real examples |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Consistent with Zed documentation tone |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No unnecessary claims about utility |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40 |       |

### Notes for Reviewer
This change affects multiple UI surfaces (breadcrumbs, outline panel, outline view) consistently. The documentation updates should be coordinated so users see consistent terminology across all three surfaces. The change is backward-compatible in behavior but changes what users see, warranting documentation updates.
