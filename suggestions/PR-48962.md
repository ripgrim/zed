### Summary
The code adds a new "Thinking Mode Off" icon and updates the thinking mode toggle UI in the agent thread view to show distinct visual states (with different icons and opacity) for enabled/disabled modes. Users need to understand this new visual indicator.

> **Preview:** This feature is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

### Thinking Mode

Thinking mode enables the agent to show its reasoning process before responding. When enabled, the agent displays its internal thought process, helping you understand how it arrived at its answer.

Toggle thinking mode using {#kb agent::ToggleThinkingMode} or the icon in the message input area:
- **Lightbulb icon**: Thinking mode is enabled
- **Crossed-out lightbulb icon** (dimmed): Thinking mode is disabled

Thinking mode is useful when you need to:
- Understand the agent's reasoning for complex problems
- Debug unexpected responses
- Learn how the agent approaches different tasks

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. This assumes the file exists and follows voice guidelines. If creating a new file, ensure the entire page meets rubric standards (direct voice, technical grounding, no hedging).

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer
- I assumed `docs/src/agent/chat.md` exists based on typical docs structure. If the agent documentation is organized differently, this content should go in the appropriate existing file about agent chat features.
- The keybinding syntax `{#kb agent::ToggleThinkingMode}` assumes the docs use this templating system for dynamic keybindings—adjust if different.
- If the entire agent feature set is still Preview-only, the Preview callout might belong at the page level rather than section level.
