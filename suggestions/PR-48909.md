_Merged: 2026-02-11T05:12:31Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48909_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
Added a new default keybinding (`Shift-Tab`) for cycling through agent modes in the agent panel. The action existed previously but lacked a default keyboard shortcut.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/agent/modes.md (or similar agent panel documentation)
- **Section**: Keybindings or "Switching Between Modes" section
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: "switch agent modes"
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Agent Modes in Zed
  description: Learn how to use and switch between Edit, Chat, and other agent modes in Zed's agent panel.
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: Include links to:
  - Agent panel overview documentation
  - Keybindings reference
  - Profile/configuration documentation
  - Relevant `zed.dev/agent` marketing page if this is a main feature page
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Preview:** This keybinding is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

Add or update a section documenting mode switching:

```markdown
## Switching Between Modes

You can switch agent modes using:
- The mode selector dropdown in the agent panel header
- {#kb agent::ToggleProfileSelector} to open the mode picker
- {#kb agent::CycleModeSelector} to cycle through available modes
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review the entire file for voice consistency, ensuring it maintains second-person present tense, avoids hedging words, and scores 4+ on all brand rubric criteria.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5    | Describes concrete UI interactions and keybindings |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5    | Direct, conversational phrasing |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5    | States capabilities without hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5    | Assumes competence, provides options |
  | Information Priority | 5/5    | Leads with actionable information |
  | Specificity          | 5/5    | Exact keybindings and UI locations |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5    | Matches Zed docs patterns |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5    | No unearned superlatives |
  | **TOTAL**            | 40/40  | Pass |

#### 2. docs/src/keybindings.md (or agent keybindings reference)
- **Section**: Agent Panel keybindings section
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: "agent panel keybindings"
- **Frontmatter**: (maintain existing if file exists)
- **Links**: Link to agent panel documentation, modes documentation, and other relevant keybinding sections
- **Suggestion**:

> **Preview:** This keybinding is available in Zed Preview. It will be included in the next Stable release.

Add entry to agent panel keybindings table:

```markdown
| Action | Default Keybinding | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| agent::CycleModeSelector | `Shift-Tab` | Cycle through agent modes |
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Ensure the entire keybindings reference maintains consistent formatting, clear descriptions, and passes brand rubric.

### Notes for Reviewer
- The action `CycleModeSelector` already existed and was shown in UI tooltips, but lacked a default keybinding until now
- If agent modes documentation doesn't exist yet, this keybinding info should be added to the general agent panel documentation
- The `Shift-Tab` binding works across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
