_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48988_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The code changes modified the behavior of the `:bd` (`:bdelete`) vim command to close files across all panes instead of just the active pane. This is a user-facing behavioral change that needs documentation.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/vim.md

- **Section**: File and window management
- **Change**: Add
- **Target keyword**: vim bdelete command zed
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Vim Mode - Zed
  description: Full Vim emulation in Zed with motions, text objects, visual mode, macros, and Zed-specific extensions.
  ---
  ```
  (No change to frontmatter - already optimized)
- **Links**: The page already has sufficient internal links (>10) to other docs sections and features, plus links to zed.dev. No additional links needed.
- **Suggestion**: 

Add the following row to the "File and window management" table (after the `:cq` row, before `:vs[plit]`):

```markdown
| `:bd[elete][!]` | Close the active file in all panes                   |
```

Full context for insertion (lines 253-270):

```markdown
| Command        | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `:w[rite][!]`  | Save the current file                                |
| `:wq[!]`       | Save the file and close the buffer                   |
| `:q[uit][!]`   | Close the buffer                                     |
| `:wa[ll][!]`   | Save all open files                                  |
| `:wqa[ll][!]`  | Save all open files and close all buffers            |
| `:qa[ll][!]`   | Close all buffers                                    |
| `:[e]x[it][!]` | Close the buffer                                     |
| `:up[date]`    | Save the current file                                |
| `:cq`          | Quit completely (close all running instances of Zed) |
| `:bd[elete][!]` | Close the active file in all panes                   |
| `:vs[plit]`    | Split the pane vertically                            |
| `:sp[lit]`     | Split the pane horizontally                          |
```

Additionally, add a Preview callout immediately before the table (after the note about `!` character being used to force commands):

```markdown
> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).
>
> The `:bd[elete]` command now closes the active file across all panes. Previously, it only closed the file in the active pane.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. The existing documentation already passes the brand rubric with high scores across all criteria. The natural, technical voice is consistent throughout. No additional voice edits are needed beyond the suggested addition.

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+ (minimum 32/40 total).

### Notes for Reviewer

The behavioral change is subtle but important: `:bd` now closes a file across all panes rather than just the current pane. This matches the user's likely expectation when working with multiple panes showing the same file.

The documentation addition follows the existing table format precisely and uses the same technical, direct voice as other vim command documentation. The "Changed in Preview" callout clearly marks this as a behavior modification for existing functionality.
