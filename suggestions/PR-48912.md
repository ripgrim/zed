# PR #48912: git: Enable the split diff for everyone

_Merged: 2026-02-11T06:28:55Z_
_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48912_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The default diff view style has changed from unified to split, and the setting is now accessible via the Settings Editor (previously behind a staff-only feature flag). Users need to understand the two diff modes and how to change between them.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/git.md

- **Section**: New section after "Project Diff" (before "File History")
- **Change**: Add new section explaining diff view modes
- **Target keyword**: "git diff view modes"
- **Frontmatter**: Current frontmatter is adequate:
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: Zed is a text editor that supports lots of Git features
  title: Zed Editor Git integration documentation
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - Internal link to [Project Diff](#project-diff) (same page)
  - Internal link to [File History](#file-history) (same page)
  - Internal link to [Stash Diff View](#stash-diff-view) (same page)
  - Internal link to [Configuring Zed](./configuring-zed.md)
  - Internal link to [Multibuffers](./multibuffers.md)
  - No marketing link needed (not a main feature page)
  
- **Suggestion**: Add the following section after the "Project Diff" section and before "File History":

```markdown
## Diff View Modes

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

Zed displays diffs in two modes: **split** (side-by-side comparison) or **unified** (inline changes). Split view is the default.

### Changing the diff view

Open the Settings Editor ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}) and search for "diff view style". Select either **Split** or **Unified**.

Or add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "diff_view_style": "unified"
}
```

See [Configuring Zed](./configuring-zed.md) for more about the Settings Editor.

### Split vs unified

- **Split**: Shows the original and modified versions side by side. Useful for comparing file structure or reviewing large changes.
- **Unified**: Shows changes inline with additions and deletions in a single view. Useful for focusing on specific line changes.

You can switch between modes at any time. Your preference applies to [Project Diff](#project-diff), [File History](#file-history), and [Stash Diff View](#stash-diff-view). These diff views function as [multibuffers](./multibuffers.md), allowing you to edit multiple excerpts simultaneously.
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Not required. The existing git.md file already maintains high voice quality throughout. The suggested addition matches the existing tone and does not introduce voice inconsistencies that would require additional changes elsewhere in the file.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4     | Clear technical descriptions, accurate setting paths, specific about what each mode shows |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Short sentences, active voice, no hedging words like "simply" or "just" |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5     | States facts directly without superlatives or marketing language |
  | Developer Respect    | 4     | Assumes reader can understand the difference, provides just enough context |
  | Information Priority | 5     | Starts with what it is, then how to change it, then details; most common task first |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Exact setting name, exact UI location, exact JSON syntax, specific examples |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5     | Matches existing git.md tone perfectly - direct, factual, practical |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | No unearned claims; states what each mode shows without claiming superiority |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38/40 | All criteria 4+; passes brand voice requirements |

### Notes for Reviewer

- The "Changed in Preview" callout is appropriate since this modifies the behavior of an existing feature (changing the default from unified to split)
- The setting is now in the Settings Editor UI under "Multibuffer" section, making it more discoverable than before
- I've prioritized Settings Editor guidance over JSON (per docs guidelines), but included JSON for users who prefer direct editing
- The feature was previously behind a staff-only flag, so most users will experience this as a new capability
